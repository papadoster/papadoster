# Hi there, I'm Alexander ðŸ‘‹

###  I'm a self-taught iOS-Developer

I used to have my own business, but because of the conflict in Ukraine, I had to move to Germany and close my business in Russia. This made me decide to change my career, and in November 2022, I started learning iOS development. I completed "The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" course at the London App Brewery School, and currently, I'm taking the "Meta iOS Developer Professional Certificate" course.

During my training, I gained practical experience in creating various types of applications, such as a weather app, chat app, task app, CoreML-based app, news app, currency converter, and more.

I would like to introduce my portfolio projects here.
